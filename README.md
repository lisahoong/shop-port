# Shop PORT

A web app that allows users to access a shared cart from select retailers built by me and my best friend Claire.
Users add their items to the shared cart, contributing to reach a free shipping or volume discount minumum, and pay for their subtotals individually.

### Project-Overview

Have you ever found yourself perusing the sale section of a retailer's website trying to find that perfect item that will just bring your total over the free-shipping minimum?

Have you ever ditched your cart completely because you couldn't hit the free shipping minimum and suddenly it didn't seem worth it anymore?

Have you ever seen a deal with some variation of "Buy # for $ each, otherwise full-price"? But you didn't need that many..

Well we have. Many times. And what did we naturally do when we ran into these scenarios? We spammed our friends, sorority sisters, housemates, etc. etc. asking if they needed anything from [insert popular store here]. So they looked, they liked, they sent links of items they wanted to add, I added, I paid, and I charged them on Venmo afterwards. Gets pretty annoying after a few times. 

So we built Port.
